## ✨ About the Project
Meow-meow! 😺  
This is our **calculator.py**, which we **struggled with for 3.5 hours** and **redid three times** before it finally started calculating… maybe.  
The program accepts expressions like `number operator number` (with spaces) (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and outputs a result. Hmmm, does it really? 

Хз, я кот, у меня лапки 🐱‍👤

Functions:  
1. `main()` – 🐾 the glavNYAya function that decides which arithmetic function to call based on your imput.  
2. `slo(x, y)` – ➕ addition (super cute! 😸)  
3. `minus(x, y)` – ➖ subtraction (cute too! 😼)  
4. `umn(x, y)` – ✖️ multiplication (paws almost got tangled 🐾)  
5. `divide(x, y)` – ➗ division (each time you divide by zero, one kitty dies 🐈)
